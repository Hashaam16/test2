# Installing Python

1. Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Click on the "Download Python" button. This will download the latest version for your OS.
3. Run the installer:
For Windows: Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now".
For macOS: Double-click the downloaded .pkg file and follow the installation wizard.
For Linux: Most distributions come with Python pre-installed. If not, use your package manager to install Python.

4. Verify the installation by opening a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and typing:
python --version
This should display the installed Python version.
